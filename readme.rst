Play Unwatched Video
######################

This script plays the first unwatched file it finds that doesn't have 'WATCHED.mp4' in it's name and then sets then tags the one it plays as 'WATCHED'

I made this script run in the morning by the task scheduler so that a video will play on my projector and wake me up in the morning.
